## Description
Our motivation for building this project was to encourage people to try new things by giving them some reassurance. This project does just that by giving users a star rating for foods they may not have tried yet. We built this project to test our knowledge of building full stack web applications using a mySQL databases, node.js, and express. We learned a lot more about connecting the frontend to the back end and storing user data to a database.

## Usage
Users can search the forum using any keywords in the search bar. Search results will automatically populate as the user is typing. Using the options on the navbar, users can create a new post or log in. However, users must be logged in to create a new post.

The login option on the navbar takes the user to a screen where members can log in or new users can sign up to be a member.

Once the user has logged in or signed up they can create and manage their posts from their profile page.
